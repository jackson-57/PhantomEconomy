PhantomEconomy v2.0.0 is an in-development version which will completely transform the plugin into what I actually wanted it to become. It will contain a plethora of new features and will hopefully have less bugs and more smiles.

Here's a list of planned features, improvements and fixes over v1-
1. (Almost complete) MySQL and SQLite database storage
2. Multiple user-configurable currencies
3. Even better settings file
4. Fully cached balances and configuration files for much better performance
5. Full non-player account support (Towny, etc)
6. (Barely started) Full bank account support (mainly for Vault)
7. API for other developers
8. (Not started) PlaceholderAPI placeholders for scoreboards, etc
9. No longer Vault-dependent
10. General code improvements
11. (Almost complete) New baltop system
12. (Not started) Import from Essentials Economy
13. (Not started) Reliance on PhantomLib
14. Several more minor things..
