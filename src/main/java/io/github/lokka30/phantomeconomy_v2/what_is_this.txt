PhantomEconomy v2.0.0 is an in-development version which will completely transform the plugin into what I actually wanted it to become. It will contain a plethora of new features and will hopefully have less bugs and more smiles.

Here's a list of planned features, improvements and fixes over v1-
1. MySQL and SQLite database storage
2. Multiple user-configurable currencies
3. Even better settings file
4. Fully cached balances and configuration files for much better performance
5. Full non-player account support (Towny, etc)
6. Full bank account support (mainly for Vault)
7. API for other developers
8. PlaceholderAPI placeholders for scoreboards, etc
9. No longer Vault-dependent
10. General code improvements
11. New baltop system
12. Import from Essentials Economy
13. Reliance on PhantomLib
14. Several more minor things..
- Command to give money to all online and/or offline players
- Server total in baltop
- Customisable 'console added $x to your account' message
- Transaction log
- [balance] sign
- Configurable repeating task which clears caches of accounts

To-do List, in order:
- Make the plugin reliant on PhantomLib, remove inbuilt logger and etc
- Add functionality to the commands
- Customisable 'console added $x to your account' message
- Make 'Command to give money to all online and/or offline players'
- Check if the plugin's commands and listeners operate properly
- Check if the plugin's databases operate properly
- Check if the Vault hook operates properly
- Add placeholderapi placeholders
- Complete the bank account implementation
- Add an import command to import essentials economy data
- Transaction log
- [Balance] sign functionality
- Remove the v1 classes and resource files from the project, replace the v2 package name with the normal package name
- Compile, push to github, release on Spigot, announce on Discord server
